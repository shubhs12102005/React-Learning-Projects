        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          At <strong>Udaan Foundation</strong>, our journey began with a simple belief â€” every child deserves a fair chance to dream, grow, and succeed.

          In many parts of our country, children face barriers like hunger, lack of access to education, and limited opportunities. Witnessing this firsthand, a small group of passionate individuals came together in 2025 with a mission to bring about change â€” one meal, one child, and one classroom at a time.

          What started as a small initiative to support school-going children with nutritious mid-day meals has now grown into a broader movement to empower communities through education, nutrition, and care. Over time, weâ€™ve seen the incredible impact of consistent support â€” students who once skipped school are now regular learners, some even pursuing higher education and inspiring their own communities.

          Our work is rooted in compassion, transparency, and a deep commitment to social equality. Each child we support is not just a beneficiary, but a future leader, doctor, artist, teacher â€” a dreamer with limitless potential.

          Today, Udaan Foundation stands as a symbol of hope â€” giving wings to thousands of dreams across India.
